                                The player that's on the <b>receiving</b> end of the signal is in charge of

                                After each successful ping a <b>resonance</b> spawns in each of the plate rooms and in

                                Each player in charge of stepping on the plates should pick up the <b>resonance</b> that

                                The players that are not pinging the signal should help out with add clear and picking

                                Killing the <b>Subjugator</b> spawns in a chest where you'll have to dunk your

                                At the start of the encounter two sets of adds spawn in. Killing these adds will spawn
                                in the 3rd set of adds. <br>
                                In the 3rd set of adds there will be a <b>yellow bar enemy</b>. Killing this enemy
                                causes the plates to <b>activate</b>. <br>
                                Successfully ping twice to spawn in 3 <b>resonances</b>. Do not pick those up just yet!
                                <br>
                                Deliberately failing the 3rd ping will cause a <b>yellow bar enemy</b>, kill this enemy
                                asap.<br>
                                During this <b>3 players</b> will be called to the middle of the room. <br>
                                This wil be indicated by a text message in the bottom left. These players will now also
                                have a buff called
                                <b>Call to Reckoning</b>. <br>
                                Ignote this until after you've killed the deliberately spawned in

                                After killing the deliberately spawned in <b>yellow bar enemy</b> phase 2 begins. <br>
                                The players with the <b>Call to Reckoning</b> buff go towards the middle where the boss
                                is. <br>
                                Their job is to shoot the head of the boss until it gives a glowing effect. <br>
                                The 3 other players that don't have the buff should be on the look out for
                                <b>blights</b>. <br>
                                Doing this successfully gives the 3 players with the <b>Call to Reckoning</b> buff a new
                                buff called <b>Stolen Favor</b>.
                                With this buff you're able to see the shape within the pillar. <br>
                            </p>

                                Call out the shape seen within the pillar and have the person closing the pillar pick
                                up that shape. <br>
                                After both players have collected their 3 stacks of <b>resonance</b> send one more ping
                                to close up the pillar. <br>
                                When all 3 pillars are close everyone should gather in the middle near the dunking
                                chest.
                                <br>
                                All players dunk their <b>resonance</b> stacks in the chest to start the damage phase.

                                During final stand the boss will spawn in 3 <b>yellow bars</b>, you can safely ignore
                                these and dps the boss down.

                                When passing the test The Witness will throw out an attack which all players have to
                                jump over. <br>
                                Failing the test or failing to jump over the attack will kill you.

                                Everyone jump up on the middle platform, here you'll be shooting the glowing chest of
                                The Witness. <br>
                                During damage phase The Witness will throw out attacks that you'll have to dodge. <br>
                                You want to call out the direction to run to when The Witness throws out his <b>first
                                    attack</b>. <br>
                                The <b>second attack</b> will come from the opposite direction <br>
                                The <b>final attack</b> of the sequence will be an attack covering the whole platform
                                requiring you to jump over. <br>
                                <i>e.g. 1st attack makes your run right then the 2nd attack will make you run left</i>
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Damage phase ends</b> when The Witness winds up a big attack. Make sure to leave the
